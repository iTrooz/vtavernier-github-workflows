# Fork notice

For some reason Github Actions would not let me use reusable workflows I used the fork button.
This is a fork nonetheless, the upstream is https://github.com/vtavernier/github-workflows/
You should probably use upstream instead of this, as this fork is only used for my personal changes, and used for https://github.com/iTrooz/efiboot-rs
